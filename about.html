      <p>Hey, I'm John Polhill and am currently living in Illinois, thus will be attending the DBC of Chicago. As far as my home town is concerned, I've moved so frequently that it is hard to keep track. In fact, I have moved more times than I am years old. Although, I did attend Yorkville High School for 3 years, so that is a place I could identify with.</p>
      <p>As for my interests, I enjoy programming, game development, video games, drawing, strategy and tactics, history of war, table-top games, rock climbing, weight lifting, sports, super heroes, animation,  and many, many other activities. I primarily enjoy doing something that increases either my physical or mental capabilities. </p>
      <p>I have graduated from Yorkville High School and currently have 1 year of college under my belt. For programming related experience, I am primarily self taught, though I have taken the AP test for computer science in high school and scored the maximum number of points, so that does count as college level programming experience.</p>
      <p>As for something quirky about myself, I'm not entirely sure what counts as quirky. I'm double jointed, can't whistle, can't blow bubble gum bubbles, I'm 20 years old and have a son who has an uncle that is younger than he is, I sing a mean Mr. Grinch, though can't really sing in general, and I still share a room with my younger brother. So, pick any of those I suppose.</p>
