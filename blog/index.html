      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <h2>Version Control and GitHub</h2>
      <h4>9/13/2015</h4>

      <p>
          I believe that an introduction is in order. My name is John Polhill. I am 20 years old currently living in Aurora IL and, like many of you that are reading this post, this is my first week of phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp. So, with that out of the way I will introduce the first topic. What are the benefits of version control? Well, I personally have not found version control to be very useful for the projects I would normally work on; however, that is only because I am a hobbyist when it comes to programming and all the work I do is solo and for fun. So, I have yet the need to keep record of my progress on a project. I do believe that when working on larger, team oriented projects that the benefits of using version control would increase exponentially. Having the ability to record the work of multiple parties and manage which of those works are accepted would be a huge boon to organization and productivity. As such, I am very certain that version control will become very beneficial for me in the future. 
      </p>

            Now that I've covered how I see version control, I will mention the software that has provided it, Git. Git will record different states of progress that one will be able to revert to and from. This allows for the ability to make major alterations without the fear of ruining the current working state of a project. Also, when a state is saved, or committed, one may include a message to describe the changes made to a project. This also helps when working on a team so members can relay information on the work they have done and at what times it was done. The ability to share information is vital to any team's success.
      </p>

          Speaking of sharing, one does not often mention git without thinking of GitHub, although the two words are not interchangeable. GitHub further increases the effectiveness of sharing information by allowing users to create repositories that can be cloned to ones own computer. Changes can then be made to any of the original code and then pushed back into GitHub. If The master user believes that the changes made were for the better he may choose to accept this push and then pull it into the original project. This is an incredibly useful tool for open source projects and any team project. Members of a team don't even have to be in the same country to be able to work together and share information and code with each other. Technology is astounding in it's ability to relay information fast and efficiently, and this ability only increases the pace of which technology expands.
