description: <a href="https://github.com/JohnP42/super-luigi">Super Luigi</a> is a Super Mario Bros. clone written in C# using the XNA framework. This was a for-fun project done on my free time and was completed in 1 week. I focused heavily on the object oriented portion of this project and the principles of game development.
